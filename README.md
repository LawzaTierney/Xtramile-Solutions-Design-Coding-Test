Answer to Task 1: 

I have not yet learned about dealing with large data systems, API's or back end development at this stage of my Software Engineering course, so I would not be able to code this if I were asked, being completely honest and transparent. I have however looked through my course and skipped further ahead to try and learn what I would do in order to answer this question. From my knowledge, what I would do is: 

Use a Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure to efficiently search for patient names based on partial input. A Trie lets me quickly find names that start with the typed prefix, and the search time is O(m), where m is the length of the search query. As the user types, I can search the Trie to find all matching names. For large datasets (500,000+ patients), I would use debouncing to avoid excessive searches and improve performance. Additionally, Iâ€™d implement server-side search with text indexing (like PostgreSQL or Elasticsearch) to better handle large datasets and ensure scalability. This way, I can make sure the search is fast, responsive, and efficient.

All of the above I will eventually learn about as I progress in my studies, and I look forward to this internship opportunity to further develop my current skills, accelerate my studies, and progress in my abiblity to deal with large data systems, API's and using text indexing features such as SQL. 


Answer to Task 2: 

As I have not learned Angluar, API's, SQL etc and I have just started learning back end development using JavaScript through Node.js, I thought that instead of just simply not attempting the question, I would instead give it my best shot with what I do know, so I have built a basic front end display for what the web page/ application would look like. As I previously mentioned, I am so looking forward to learning back end development, connecting the front end to the back, and learning about API's. I am so determined to learn and get better and I really hope that through this internship opportunity I get real life experience about how this all works :).
